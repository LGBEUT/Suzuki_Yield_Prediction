# Suzuki_Yield_Prediction
This is a non-exhaustive list of methods for creating machine learning algorithms for yield prediction.

## Datat_set : Suzuki 
This dataset originates from a recent publication by a Pfizer team. Utilizing flow chemistry, they conducted a high-throughput reaction screening of the Suzuki–Miyaura C–C coupling reaction. This screening involved 11 reactants, 12 ligands, 8 bases, and 4 solvents, resulting in a total of 5760 reactions. The predictive target in this dataset is the reaction yield. (D. Perera, J. W. Tucker, S. Brahmbhatt, C. J. Helal, A. Chong, W. Farrell, P. Richardson and N. W. Sach, Science, 2018, 359, 429–434.)
